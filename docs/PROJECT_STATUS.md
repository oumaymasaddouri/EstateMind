## Known Limitations

### Development Mode
1. **No Database Connection**: Requires PostgreSQL setup
2. **Mock User IDs**: Property APIs use placeholder user IDs
3. **No Authentication Middleware**: Routes not yet protected
4. **No Rate Limiting**: Needs implementation for production

### Security
- Mock authentication in property endpoints
- Missing authorization checks
- 4 npm vulnerabilities to address
- No rate limiting implemented

**Note**: All limitations are documented in SECURITY.md and are acceptable for Phase 1.
